#What is Meteor?

Meteor is basically a stack of technologies. A lot of it is open source existing technology. Meteor is a pure JavaScript full stack framework for creating realtime interactive applications. I

ts simplicity allows for quick prototyping and building more complex applications faster than ever. The Meteor Development Group has created a framework which shifts away from the traditional web framework paradigm, while building on trusted open-source technologies. This session will cover the following: What is Meteor what makes it so special How to install and use Meteor Meteor app demo with code examples.
