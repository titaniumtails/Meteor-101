# Android and iOS Deployment

So far, we've been building our app and testing only in a web browser, but Meteor has been designed to work across different platforms - your simple todo list website can become an iOS or Android app in just a few commands.

Meteor makes it easy to set up all of the tools required to build mobile apps, but downloading all of the programs can take a while - for Android the download is about 300MB and for iOS you need to install Xcode which is about 2GB.
