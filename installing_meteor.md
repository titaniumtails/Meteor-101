# Getting Started

We'll run through the very basic foundation of getting setup in Meteor.

## Installing meteor

To install the newest version of Meteor with one command on OS X or Linux. Open your terminal and type:


```unix
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

##Creating a Meteor App

```unix
meteor create myNewApp
```

We need a separation of concerns. So we create a separation of concerns:
- Client
- Server
